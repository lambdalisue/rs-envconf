# serviceconf-derive

Derive macro implementation for the [`serviceconf`](https://docs.rs/serviceconf) crate.

**Note:** You should use the [`serviceconf`](https://docs.rs/serviceconf) crate directly, which re-exports this derive macro along with the necessary runtime support.

This crate provides the `#[derive(ServiceConf)]` procedural macro that automatically generates environment variable loading code for configuration structs.

For documentation, examples, and usage instructions, please see the [`serviceconf`](https://docs.rs/serviceconf) crate.
